# 📝 Notes Apps

**Network Pro Strategies** (Network Pro&trade;)<br />
**Last Updated:** November 16, 2025

Secure and private note-taking apps ensure your thoughts, plans, and sensitive information remain under your control. Unlike traditional note apps that sync through third-party cloud services, these alternatives prioritize encryption, local storage, or end-to-end encrypted syncing. Whether you need a minimalist encrypted notebook like Notesnook, a robust platform with cross-device sync like Standard Notes, or a local-first knowledge base like Obsidian, these tools offer flexible solutions without compromising your privacy.
