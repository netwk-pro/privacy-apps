This section highlights free and open-source email clients designed with privacy, local control, and open standards in mind. These tools offer robust features without data harvesting, enabling secure, customizable email access free from vendor lock-in or intrusive tracking.

- An incredibly privacy-conscious app with lots of options and functionality.
- Once you get past the learning curve, it's probably one of the best email clients period.

- K-9 Mail has long been one of the leading email clients on Android. It's mature, privacy-focused, and open source.

<img src="../img/apps/thunderbird.png" width="20" height="20" alt="Thunderbird Mobile" /> [Thunderbird Mobile](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/mobile/) <sup>[F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/net.thunderbird.android/)</sup> 🇺🇸 <sup>US</sup> ⭐

- Newer on the scene, but feature set is similar to K-9 Mail.

> Thunderbird Mobile and K-9 Mail share the same code base and are, therefore, very similar. It's expected that K-9 Mail will ultimately wind down at some point, as the K-9 Mail project joined the Thunderbird family in 2022.
