While SMS is not a secure protocol, it remains a default communication channel on most phones — especially when interacting with contacts who don't use encrypted messengers. This section highlights minimal, privacy-respecting SMS apps that avoid tracking, ads, and unnecessary permissions, offering a clean interface for managing legacy SMS/MMS messaging!

!!! warning "Limitations of SMS"

    While SMS remains useful for communicating with contacts who don’t use encrypted messengers, it is fundamentally **insecure and privacy-invasive** by design:

      - Messages are **not end-to-end encrypted** — they can be intercepted by carriers, governments, or attackers.
      - SMS exposes **metadata**, including sender, recipient, and timestamps.
      - Content is typically stored in plaintext on carrier infrastructure.
      - It is vulnerable to **SIM swap attacks**, **SS7 protocol exploitation**, and **carrier-level surveillance**.

    Even with the most privacy-conscious SMS app, you're only improving the **local interface**, not the security of the messages themselves.

    > For sensitive communication, use an end-to-end encrypted messaging platform such as Signal, Session, or Matrix.
